# Note-Taking-App

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

    My motivation to build this website was to experiment with back end as its a new subject to me and even still confuses me slightly. I wanted to see if I could link the front end to the back end in order to make a full website.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    I built this as an example to test my skills. Back end is a new subject to me and i wanted to use backend to improve upon a previous module where you can take notes and save or deletes them for later.

- What problem does it solve?

    This solves the proiblem of linking back end and front end parts of the project together. The note app has the usefullness to take notes to have for later use as reminders of what to do. This website (hopefully by the time i finish it) is an example of what can be done when two different worlds of coding combine.

- What did you learn?

    I learned how to link two different html's together using routes as well as get, post, and delete requests in terms of backend commands. i learned how to use a db.json to store information to display on the webpage. Overall I learned how to link the front end development with the back end
